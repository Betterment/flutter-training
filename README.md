## What to expect?

### Lectures

Each day we will cover a number of topics that will be introduced in modules that include a lecture and a workshop portion. Each module will last about 1-2 hours, with a 15 min break between each module.

For each workshop, you will be divided into teams of 4 people and a facilitator. Each team will have its own Zoom breakout room, where they will work together through the workshop excercises.

Each excercise will have a designated driver whose responsibility will be to share their screen and work through the exercise, speaking out loud and asking the team for suggestions. The other team members' responsibility will be to actively engage in helping the driver by offering ideas, suggestions, alternative soultions, and concerns. We will rotate drivers for each exercise, so everyone will have a chance of being the driver.

At the end of the workshop, the teams will reconvene in the main Zoom lobby to review solutions with the instructor. Participants are encouraged to share their alternative solutions or problems that they encountered at this time.

### Build Time

The latter part of the week will be devoted to working through implementing a number of components and screens from our Betterment mobile app. In order to provide support during this time, we will offer Office Hours where you can come chat with any of the training facilitators to either help you get unstuck on a problem, or simply to have a chance of having a more in-depth discussion about any of the training topics that you would like to go over. 

### Office Hours

On Thursday and Fridays, facilitators will be available for Office Hours held via Zoom. Participants will have the chance to sign up for a 30-min slot to book a time to chat.

### Show & Tell

Each week will wrap up with a Show & Tell presentation where participants will showcase the work they produced during Build Time with the rest of the team.

	- Update your Slack status to "Flutter training" to let other people know that you're not available during this time
	- Turn your email off
- Practice good Zoom ettiquete 
	- Set yourself in a quiet environment with good lighting and a good microphone

## Prerequisites

Please verify your Zoom installation ahead of the training, as well as your camera and microphone setup.

Also make sure you go through the following setup steps ahead of the training, as they can be time consuming. Plan on doing this the week before the training.

If you encounter any issues, we'll be happy to provide support - just post a message in the #flutter-training channel.
