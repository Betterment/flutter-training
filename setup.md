## 1. Install Xcode

It is _very important_ that we are all using the same version of Xcode. Our mobile codebase currently expect us to be on Xcode 11.2.1.

In order to install Xcode, _**do not**_ install it from the App Store since this can trigger automatic version updates in the future that might not be compatible with our codebase.

* Install Xcode using [this link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/oegetvzr55fpfpk/Xcode_11.2.1.xip?dl=0)
* Drag Xcode to your `Applications` folder
* Start Xcode
	- The first time you open it, it might ask you to agree to the License Agreement. 
	
	**Select AGREE**

	- The first time you open it, it might ask you if you want to install additional components
	
	**Select INSTALL.**
